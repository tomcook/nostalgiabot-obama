Content for the Obama Administration Nostalgia Bot

This repository has the raw data that feeds into the "Obama Nostalgia" twitter bot, which can be found here: https://twitter.com/ObamaNostalgia.

It includes an archive of the actual images, fetched from Flickr, for safe keeping in case their API changes or the photos are put in a less-accessible place.

"memories.json" has all of the metadata, captions, and other bits that are assembled into the twitter caption.

The data in here is fetched by a (currently non-public) bot that randomly selects a photo and posts it to Twitter on a schedule.
